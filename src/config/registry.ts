 * Where the site points.

 * renamed or retired in exactly one place and the two can never disagree about
 * what the site contains. Nothing here decides how a link is DRAWN — that is
 * the header's and the footer's business.
 *
 * The one structural rule: a section with `items` has a menu, and the header
 * draws a chevron because it has one. A section without items is a plain link.
 * There is no separate "show a chevron" flag to get out of step with reality.
