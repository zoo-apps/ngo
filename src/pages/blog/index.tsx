/**
 * Research, not a newsroom.
 *
 * This page carried six invented news stories: a $500K grant approved, twelve
 * tigers rescued from the illegal wildlife trade, 98% species accuracy across
 * 2,300 species — two of them bylined to people who do not exist, "Dr. Sarah
 * Chen" and "Michael Torres". A credentialled name on a fabricated result is
 * how a reader stops checking.
 *
 * The species paper reports 91.2%, 94.7% and 95% on its own benchmarks, and
 * never 98%. So the page now lists work that was actually published, each entry
 * linking to the paper it summarises, and every summary drawn from that paper's
 * own abstract. One author, and it is the foundation.

    blurb:
      'Most classifiers need hundreds of labelled images per species. Most species do not have them — which is why automated monitoring stalls exactly where biodiversity is richest. This is what few-shot recognition can and cannot do about that.',
    paper: 'zoo-species-classification',

    topic: 'Field methods',
    title: 'The camera trap images nobody has looked at',
    blurb:
      'Camera networks produce millions of frames a year across conservation sites, and most are never processed because a person has to look at them. Deep learning for population monitoring and habitat assessment, and where it still needs a human.',

    topic: 'Climate',
    title: 'Where a species will be able to live',
    blurb:
      'Classical distribution models lean on correlations that break as the climate moves outside their training range. A neural approach to predicting range shifts, so protection is planned for where an animal is going rather than where it has been.',

    topic: 'Privacy',
    title: 'Sharing a model without sharing the recordings',
    blurb:
      'Wildlife monitoring data is sensitive — the location of an endangered animal most of all — and it sits with independent institutions running different sensors. Federated training with differential privacy, so sites improve a shared model and keep their own data.',
    paper: 'zoo-federated-wildlife',
  },
  {
    topic: 'Accountability',
    title: 'Most forest carbon offsets may not be real',
    blurb:
      'Analyses suggest 70–90% of certified forest carbon credits represent reductions that did not happen. Measurement and verification infrastructure for nature-based credits, aimed at the part of the market that cannot currently be checked.',
