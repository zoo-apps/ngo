/**
 * What the research is, rather than what we wish it had already done.
 *
 * This page used to claim $12.3M in conservation funding, 15,420 animals
 * rescued, 284,000 volunteer hours, deployment to 200+ sites, 15 million images
 * analysed and 98% accuracy. The foundation's IRS determination is dated June
 * 2025 and the public record carries no filing; none of those things happened,
 * and a donor reading them was being misled about what their money had done.
 *
 * What did happen is the research below — every line links to the paper it
 * describes, so the claim and its evidence are the same click.

            We have not run a rescue operation, funded a sanctuary, or deployed a sensor
            network. When we do, the count will be on this page with the evidence beside it.
            Until then this page is short, and that is the honest length.
